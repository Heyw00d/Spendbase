Hi [Company] team,

I'm Chris, founder of Spendbase (spendbase.cards) — a comparison site for crypto debit cards.

We rank 70+ cards by cashback rates, fees, Trustpilot scores, and self-custody options. We're seeing solid traffic from people actively searching for crypto cards.

[Company Card] is already in our database. Reaching out about two things:

1. **Accuracy** — Want to make sure your card details are current
2. **Featured placement** — We offer sponsored positions for select partners

Our audience is high-intent: people comparing cards before signing up. Featured cards get:
- Top placement in search results
- "Featured" badge and highlight
- Newsletter inclusion (launching soon)
- Dedicated review page with your messaging

Would love to connect with whoever handles partnerships or marketing. Happy to share traffic data and discuss options.

Best,
Chris

Hi,

Last follow-up on this. If partnership/sponsorship isn't a fit right now, no worries.

Either way — good luck with [Company Card].

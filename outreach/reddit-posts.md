# Reddit Post Drafts for Spendbase

## Post 1: r/cryptocurrency — Value Post (Main Launch)

**Title:** I spent 3 months comparing 70+ crypto debit cards. Here's what I found.

**Body:**
```
I got tired of digging through shill posts and affiliate garbage trying to find a good crypto card, so I built a comparison site.

**The TL;DR after comparing 70+ cards:**

**Best overall:** Bybit Card — up to 10% cashback, Netflix/Spotify rebates, but only in EU
**Best for self-custody:** Gnosis Pay — true self-custody, Visa, but EU only  
**Best for US:** Coinbase Card — up to 4% back, regulated, but 2.49% FX fee
**Best DeFi-native:** Ether.fi Cash — spend while staking, ETHFI rewards
**Best Solana:** Phantom Card — 2% in $CASH, non-custodial

**What I learned:**
1. "Up to X% cashback" is usually bullshit — you need to stake tokens or hit volume tiers
2. Self-custody cards are finally here (Gnosis, Phantom, KAST) but limited regions
3. Trustpilot ratings vary wildly — Binance has 1.5/5, Bybit has 3.2/5
4. Most cards are EU/global only — US options are limited

**Red flags to watch:**
- Cards requiring huge token stakes for advertised rates
- No Trustpilot presence or <2.0 rating
- "Coming soon" for 2+ years
- Vague custody terms

I put everything in a comparison table at spendbase.cards — sortable by cashback, fees, custody type, region.

No affiliate links on the comparison. Just trying to make this space less confusing.

What cards are you all using? Curious what's actually working for people.

## Post 2: r/defi — DeFi Angle

**Title:** Comparing DeFi-native crypto cards (Ether.fi, Gnosis Pay, Phantom, etc.)

**Body:**
```
Been researching crypto cards that actually let you stay on-chain / self-custody. Here's what exists:

**True self-custody:**
- **Gnosis Pay** — EURe stablecoin on Gnosis Chain, Visa, EU only
- **Phantom Card** — Solana-native, 2% in $CASH stablecoin
- **KAST** — Solana, non-custodial, 2-15% in KAST points

**DeFi-integrated (not fully self-custody but close):**
- **Ether.fi Cash** — Spend against staked ETH without unstaking
- **Holyheld** — Multi-chain (14 chains), gas subsidized

**The catch:** Most are EU/LatAm only. US is still stuck with custodial options (Coinbase, Gemini).

Full breakdown at spendbase.cards/card/Gnosis%20Pay (or any card name)

Anyone using these? How's the experience with on-ramp times and limits?

## Post 3: r/solana — Solana Cards

**Title:** Solana crypto cards comparison (Phantom, KAST, Solayer, Backpack)

**Body:**
```
Solana ecosystem now has multiple card options. Here's the breakdown:

| Card | Cashback | Custody | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Phantom | 2% in $CASH | Non-custodial | Live |
| KAST K Card | 2-6% in points | Non-custodial | Live |
| KAST X Card | 5-12% | Non-custodial | Live |
| Solayer Emerald | 2-4% LAYER | Non-custodial | Live |
| Solflare | TBD | Self-custody | Waitlist |
| Backpack | TBD | Exchange | Live |

**My take:**
- Phantom is easiest if you already use the wallet
- KAST has highest rewards but points (token coming Q2)
- Solayer is premium ($75/yr) but sUSD earns 4-5% APY

All non-custodial which is huge. Compare them at spendbase.cards

Which one are you using?

## Post 4: r/creditcards — Crossover Audience

**Title:** Crypto debit cards as daily drivers — anyone doing this?

**Body:**
```
Traditional credit card guy here. Been looking at crypto cards for the cashback rates.

Some of these are insane compared to traditional cards:
- Bybit: up to 10% (EU only)
- KAST: up to 15% 
- Crypto.com: up to 8% (need $40K CRO stake though)

Compared to my Chase 1.5% unlimited...

**The catches I've found:**
1. Most high rates require staking tokens worth thousands
2. Rewards paid in crypto tokens (volatile)
3. Limited regions — US options max out at ~4%
4. These are debit cards, not credit — no purchase protection, no credit building

I built a comparison at spendbase.cards to sort through the 70+ options.

Anyone here using crypto cards as their primary? How's the experience?

## Post 5: r/digitalnomad — Travel Angle

**Title:** Best crypto cards for traveling (0% FX fees)

**Body:**
```
If you're spending in multiple currencies, crypto cards can beat traditional travel cards:

**0% FX fee cards:**
- Bybit Card (EU)
- Gnosis Pay (EU)
- KAST (Global)
- MetaMask Card (Global)
- Ready (Global)

**Why it works:**
- Load USDC/stablecoins
- Card converts at spot rate
- No 1-3% FX markup

**The reality check:**
- Need to manage stablecoin on-ramps
- Some have ATM withdrawal limits
- Customer support can be sketchy (check Trustpilot)

I compared 70+ cards at spendbase.cards — you can filter by region and FX fees.

Any nomads using these? What's your setup?

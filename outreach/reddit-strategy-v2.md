## Phase 1: Karma Building (Days 1-7) — THIS WEEK
**Goal:** Get to 50-100 karma, establish as crypto-interested user

### Quick Karma Subs (low/no requirements):
- r/AskReddit — answer trending questions (easy 10-50 karma per comment)
- r/NoStupidQuestions — helpful answers
- r/todayilearned — engage in comments

### Crypto Presence (comment only, no links):
- r/cryptocurrency — comment on threads about cards/spending
- r/ethfinance — engage on ether.fi related posts
- r/solana — discuss Phantom card, ecosystem
- r/defi — answer questions about DeFi cards

### Day 1-3 Comment Templates:
**When someone asks "best crypto card":**
> "Depends on your region. EU has way more options — Bybit does up to 10% cashback. US is stuck with Coinbase (4% max) and Gemini. Self-custody is the big differentiator now — Gnosis Pay and Phantom both let you keep your keys."

**When someone mentions ether.fi:**
> "The Cash Card is interesting — spend against staked ETH without unstaking. Basically 'buy now, pay never' if ETH keeps appreciating."

**On crypto card complaint threads:**
> "Most cards with 'up to X%' require insane token stakes. Always check what the actual base rate is without staking."

## Phase 2: Value Posts (Days 7-14)
**Goal:** First substantive posts, establish expertise

### Post 1: r/defi or r/ethfinance
**Title:** "DeFi-native crypto cards — comparing what's actually live right now"
- Pure comparison, no link to Spendbase
- List Gnosis Pay, Phantom, ether.fi Cash, KAST, Holyheld
- Ask "what are you using?"
- Drop Spendbase link ONLY if someone asks "where can I compare these"

### Post 2: r/solana
**Title:** "Solana crypto cards comparison — Phantom vs KAST vs Solayer vs Backpack"
- Table format comparison
- Genuine analysis of pros/cons
- Same approach — link only if asked

### Post 3: r/digitalnomad
**Title:** "Best crypto cards for travel (0% FX fees)"
- Practical angle for nomads
- Compare to traditional travel cards
- High engagement sub

---

## Phase 3: Authority Posts (Days 14-21)
**Goal:** Major posts with organic Spendbase mentions

### The Big Post: r/cryptocurrency
**Title:** "I spent 3 months comparing 70+ crypto debit cards. Here's what I found."
- Deep analysis post
- Include link to spendbase.cards naturally
- "I put it all in a comparison table at spendbase.cards"
- Should have enough karma by now

### r/creditcards Crossover Post
**Title:** "Crypto cards vs traditional cards as daily drivers — real numbers"
- Appeal to the credit card optimization crowd
- Show where crypto cards actually beat traditional ones

---

## Ongoing: Comment Strategy

### Search Terms to Monitor Daily:
- "crypto card" / "crypto debit card"
- "best crypto card 2026"
- "USDC card" / "stablecoin card"
- "self custody card"
- "Bybit card" / "Crypto.com card"
- "spend crypto" / "crypto spending"
- "digital nomad card"

### Reply Framework:
1. **Answer their specific question first** (don't pivot to Spendbase)
2. **Add genuine value** (a comparison they didn't have)
3. **Only mention Spendbase if natural** ("I actually built a comparison for this")
4. **Never sound like an ad**

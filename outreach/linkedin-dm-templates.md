Hi [First Name],

I run Spendbase — a crypto card comparison site that's ranking for searches like "best crypto card 2025."

[Company Card] is listed but I wanted to:

We're seeing [X] monthly visitors actively comparing cards. Could be a solid channel for you.

## Template 3: Partnerships/BD (Collaboration Angle)

**Message:**

Hey [First Name],

Reaching out because we built Spendbase — think NerdWallet but for crypto cards. 70+ cards compared, real Trustpilot scores, cashback rates.

[Company] is already in our database. Two things:

1. Want to make sure your listing is 100% accurate
2. Exploring sponsorship/featured spots for select partners

Would love to connect and explore. Open to a quick call?

## Tips:
- **Keep it under 100 words** — busy people skim
- **Mention their company** — shows it's not spam
- **Clear CTA** — "5 min call" or "worth a chat?"
- **Don't pitch hard** — offer value first (accurate listing)
- **Follow up once** after 5-7 days if no response
